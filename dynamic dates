See the attached power query.

In the source it has:
= {Number.From(#date(2000,1,1))..Number.From(Date.AddYears(Date.From(DateTime.LocalNow()),2))}

What this is saying the date range will always be Jan 1, 2000 to 2 years from today. You can do AddMonths to this as well. 

The code after changes it to monthly and adds some additional columns.
